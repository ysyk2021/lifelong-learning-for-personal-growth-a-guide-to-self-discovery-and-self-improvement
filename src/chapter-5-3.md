* **Learn from Mistakes:** Extract lessons and insights from your failures. Use them as opportunities to improve and adjust your approach. Focus on progress rather than dwelling on past mistakes.

3. Analyze and Reflect
----------------------

* **Seek Understanding:** Analyze the reasons behind the setback or failure. Identify any patterns, external factors, or internal limitations that may have contributed to the outcome.
* **Reflect on Lessons Learned:** Take time to reflect on the experience and extract valuable lessons. Consider how you can apply these lessons moving forward, adjusting your strategies and actions accordingly.
